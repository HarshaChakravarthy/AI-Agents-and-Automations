## T-Shirt Image Generator

### Problem statement:
Merch design pipelines stall at the concepting stage; designers need quick visual options to iterate.

### Inputs:
Theme/prompt; optional palette or style guide.

### Solution / Workflow:
Convert the theme into a strong image prompt (agentic LLM).
Generate variations and format/resize assets for mockups.
Save deliverables to Drive and produce a keywords/metadata row in Sheets.

### Tools & frameworks:
n8n • OpenAI (LLM) • Image generation API • Google Drive • Google Sheets

### Recommendations:
Apply basic safety filters for NSFW content.
Keep style presets (minimalist, vintage, bold) to match your brand.
Track top-performing prompts over time.

### Conclusion:
Fast idea generation accelerates reviews and increases the rate of publishable designs.
