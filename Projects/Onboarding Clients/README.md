## Onboarding Clients

### Problem statement:
Manual onboarding introduces errors, delays, and missing data.

### Inputs:
Onboarding form data (name, contact, company, package, preferences).

### Solution / Workflow:
Validate required fields; normalize names/addresses.
Enrich via HTTP API lookups if needed (e.g., website, domain).
Persist to Google Sheets or CRM.
Send a welcome email and notify the owner channel; keep an audit log.

### Tools & frameworks:
n8n • HTTP Request • Google Sheets • Gmail • Webhooks

### Recommendations:
Use idempotency on email/externalId to avoid duplicates.
Keep a checklist for package-specific tasks.
Add a “missing data” route for follow-up.

### Conclusion:
Standardized onboarding reduces back-and-forth and ensures every client is set up correctly.

### Note:
APIs & credentials not included: This repo contains only n8n workflows. No live API endpoints, keys, or third-party credentials are provided—configure your own in n8n (Settings → Credentials) before running.
